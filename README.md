# workout-plan

Welcome to a quick workout template I threw together when I found myself spending too much time figuring out percentages at the gym.

The workout template is based on Wendler's 5-3-1 strength training program.

Simply, fork and clone the repository.

Navigate to the root in your terminal.

Run `python3 orm.py`

Follow the prompts.

I am building out a front end to make the process easier - but this works in a pinch.
